    <h1>Sai Achyuth Konda does Chekov tonight</h1>
    <h3>THE THREE SISTERS - Anton Checkov</h3>
<p>
[Scene as before. It is 8 p.m. Somebody is heard playing a concertina
outside in' the street. There is no fire. NATALIA IVANOVNA enters in
indoor dress carrying a candle; she stops by the door which leads into
ANDREY'S room.]   <br>

ANDREY. I was just thinking.... There is really nothing to say.... <br>

NATASHA. Yes... there was something I wanted to tell you.... Oh, yes.
Ferapont has come from the Council offices, he wants to see you. <br>

ANDREY. [Yawns] Call him here. <br>

[NATASHA goes out; ANDREY reads his book, stooping over the candle she
has left behind. FERAPONT enters; he wears a tattered old coat with the
collar up. His ears are muffled.] <br>

ANDREY. Good morning, grandfather. What have you to say? <br>

FERAPONT. The Chairman sends a book and some documents or other.
Here.... [Hands him a book and a packet.] <br>

ANDREY. Thank you. It's all right. Why couldn't you come earlier? It's
past eight now.   <br>

FERAPONT. What?
